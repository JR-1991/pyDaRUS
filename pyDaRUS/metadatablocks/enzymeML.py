            temperature_unit (string): Specifies the corresponding SI unit to the temperature value.
            ph_value (number): Specifies the pH value at which the experiment was executed. Please note that pH values should fall in between the interval 0-14.
            educts (string): Specifies the participating reactants/proteins which serve as educts. If multiple educts have been used, separate each of them via semicolon ';'.
            products (string): Specifies the participating reactants/proteins which serve as products. If multiple products have been used, separate each of them via semicolon ';'.
            modifiers (string): Specifies the participating reactants/proteins which serve as modifiers. For instance catalysing proteins should be entered as modifiers, which is the same for activators/inhibitors. If multiple modifiers have been used, separate each of them via semicolon ';'.
            equation (string): Specifies the reaction equation by separating educts and products via '->', while denoting multiple educts/products with a plusign and stoichiometries by 'Y Molecule'. For instance the following describes an alcohol dehydrogenation '1 Ethanol + 1 NAD+ -> 1 Acetaldehyde + 1 NADH + 1 H+'.
